a) Write up a brief description of the energy/mineral/economic system you’d like to model
b) Describe the data you plan to use and include summary statistics or a plot (or two)… do not hesitate to make reasonable assumptions where data are lacking
c) Describe the model’s math the same way we did in class on Monday – define indices, parameters, variables as well as the objective function and constraints
